Master repository for my Thesis Project for the Diploma from the [Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Technology](http://www.ece.upatras.gr/en/), University of Patras, Greece.

It is shared under the [Apache license version 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) to serve as boilerplate for future Thesis manuscripts as also to further the research in the relevant areas.

The **Thesis Manuscript** can be found in pdf at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336564357_An_IoT_Edge-as-a-service_Eaas_Distributed_Architecture_Reference_Implementation).

The repository is divided into 2 main directories:

 -  **Thesis:** The latex source directory for the thesis manuscript, it contains all the relevant images, texts and every file needed to compile the thesis in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). The latex template was forked from [Nikos Tsiknakis repository](https://github.com/tsikup/ece-upatras-thesis-template) whom I wholeheartly thank for his assistance during my latex virgin voyage. *XeLaTEX* was used for compilation.
 
- **Source:** The directory of all the source files needed to replicate the reference implementation. The implementation is based on [balena](https://www.balena.io/) for the Edge devices and [node-RED](https://nodered.org/) for the supporting backend. Further details on installation, configuration and functionality can be found in the Implementation Chapter of the Thesis.
