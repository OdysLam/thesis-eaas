Master repository for my Thesis Project for the Diploma  from the [Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Technology](http://www.ece.upatras.gr/en/), University of Patras, Greece.

It is shared under the Apache license to serve as boilerplate for future Thesis manuscripts as also to further the research in the relevant areas.

The repository is divided into 2 main directories:

 -  **Thesis:** The latex source directory for the thesis manuscript, it contains all the relevant images, texts and every file needed to compile the thesis in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
 
- **Source:** The directory of all the source files needed to replicate the reference implementation. The implementation is based on [balena](https://www.balena.io/) for the Edge devices and [node-RED](https://nodered.org/) for the supporting backend. Further details on installation, configuration and functionality can be found in the Implementation Chapter of the Thesis.
