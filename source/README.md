## This is a work in progress ##.

Please note that the Implementation Chapter can serve as a walkthrough for configuring and running the implementation on the appropriate hardware.

The Node-RED device-service that is mentioned in the implementation can be found in a seperate repository [here](https://github.com/OdysLam/edgex-nodered-device-service).
